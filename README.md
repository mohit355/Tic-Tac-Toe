# Name of the Project:   Tic-Tac-Toe
TicTacToe or X’s and O’s is a very popular paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
The main purpose of this project is to convert this paper-and-pencil game to a software game to reduce the wastage of paper as well as paper ink.
        Suppose you are alone and you want to play this game but this is a two-player game. Here the need for this game comes in the play where you can play with the computer.
        
        
 ## Description
      
        The game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself.  It is actually a two-player game. In this game,  there is a board with n x n squares.
	In our game, it is 3x3 squares. The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row, that may be horizontally,
	vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.This game can be played in a 3x3 grid. The game can be played by two players where the players can be-
	User(Humans)
	Computer(machine)
  
### 1. Two modes of game :
          	>User  vs Computer
         	>User  vs User
        
### 2.  Each game mode has a further three-game type named as follows-
		  >One match game
   		  >Three match game
  		  >Five match game 
        
        

## technical aspect:

### 1. language used : Java
### 2. IDE used      : Intelij IDEA
### 3. Modules used  : swing,awt,random,utils etc

      NOTE: All modules used in this game is in-built modules. So no need to install it.


## Key features of My project :


   ### Player selection flexibility:
		>Users can either play with friends or can play with the computer.
 
   ### You will be informed when your turn comes :
                >Symbols (0’s or X’’s) will assign to you and whenever you change come then that symbol light up below you name.

   ### Flexibility of game mode selection:
		>There are three modes of the game type available (one game, three-game,five-game). So you get the flexibility to select anyone
		(three-game and five-game types are tournament type)

   ### Result output:
		 >The result of each match will be declared on the screen and when series complete (especially for 3-game and 5-game mode)
		 then you have an option to see the full result of each match and final winner of each series.


## How to run:
   
  ### 1. Using Intelij IDEA IDE
    
    >Step1: Fork this repository
    >Step2: Click on *code* button at right side
    >Step3: Click on **Download Zip** (download will started)
    >Step4: Extract the file from the file (one folder will extracted from the zip which contains subfolder)
    >Step5: Change the folder name "Tic-Tac-Toe-master" to 'Tic-Tac-Toe' (folder name is same as .iml available in that folder).
    >Step6: Load that folder in **Intelij IDEA IDE**. (not ready to run need some setup)
    >Step7: Set src folder as source folder (File-> project structure -> Modules -> src -> Sources)
    >Step8: Set images folder as Resources ( File-> project structure -> Modules -> src -> Resources)
    >Step8: Run the program by Right click -> Run  on Main.java.
    
    	NOTE: Each step is required . If you miss any step then it will show errors
